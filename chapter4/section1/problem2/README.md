Chapter 4 Section 1 Problem 2
=============================

- [Thoughts][thoughts]

### Thoughts ###

Not too bad of a problem, just that it had weird requirements about the mod
being less than the word size. I think it was hinting at the proofs `(a+b) mod
m = (a mod m + b mod m) mod m` and `(a-b) mod m = (a mod m - b mod m) mod m`,
which was my implementation.
