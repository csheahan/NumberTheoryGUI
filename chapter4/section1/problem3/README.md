Chapter 4 Section 1 Problem 3
=============================

- [Thoughts][thoughts]

### Thoughts ###

First of all, the book says the problem to get your method from is exercise 31,
but the exercise I think they meant was 29, as 31 had nothing to do with modular
multiplication. Another struggle was that the method was split across multiple
parts, so I had to connect the dots a little. Otherwise, it was fairly straight
forward, although there were quite a lot of variables.
