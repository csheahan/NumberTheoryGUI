### Thoughts ###

At first the problem seemed confusing. It was fairly open ended, and I coldn't
think of a solid approach to solve it. However, after playing around a little
with the numbers, I noticed that if p/q=α, then the equation is guaranteed to
hold because the left hand side of the equation is 0. Thus, to generate
infinite p's and q's, simply set p to α*α, q to α, then scale both to nα where
n is an integer.
