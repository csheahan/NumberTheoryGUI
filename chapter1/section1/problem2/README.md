Chapter 1 Section 1 Problem 2

### Thoughts ###

This problem was fairly straightforward. Simply generate a sequence, no need
for complex algorithms or tricks. Really the only gotchya would be if the floor
function operated contrary to the mathematical floor function (which I believe
it does act differently in certain languages), but luckily that is not a
problem in Python.
