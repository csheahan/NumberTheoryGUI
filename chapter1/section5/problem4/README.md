### Thoughts ###

The Collatz problem is one that is pretty familiar, as I have had to do it a
couple times before in school. I took the simple approach, as I couldn't use
any tricks to skip (If I did, I wouldn't have the full sequence). Additionally,
using an in memory cache might be overkill, as I would have to end up cacheing
the full arrays then merge them, which would be annoying. In the end, a fairly
routine problem using the straight-forward, unoptimized solution.
