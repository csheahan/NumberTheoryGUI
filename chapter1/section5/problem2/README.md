Chapter 1 Section 5 Problem 2
=============================

- [Thoughts][thoughts]

### Thoughts ###

Another fairly easy problem for a computer in this section. All one has to do 
is take advantage of the fact that integers automatically truncate, then 
calculating the remainder can either be done through modulus or simple 
subtraction, which is the path I went with becuase I used modulus for 1.5.1.
