### Thoughts ###

This problem was quite a fun one to solve. I wanted to resist the temptation
to try brute forcing the problem, and am quite pleased I was able to do so. My
approach to figure out a way to do so was to first solve the proof associated
with the problem: that of showing that it was possible to cover a 2^n x 2^n
chessboard with L shaped pieces. This can be simply done via induction, so
a recursive divide and conquor algorithm seemed appropriate.
