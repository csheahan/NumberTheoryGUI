### Thoughts ###

This problem was a pretty lucky solve. I guessed a simple, brute-forceish type
approach and it seemed to have worked out. Another cool thing was that I found
out that python has a fraction class, which made this infinitely easier, as my
initial approach using floating point numbers, which led to inaccuracies that
would have been very frustrating to fix.
