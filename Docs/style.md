===========

This is the style guide for the whole repo. If you wish to contribute to this
repo, you must follow this style guide. Given that, there won't be much style
requirements, and they should be easy enough to follow.

General

- No line should be longer than 80 characters. Although this isn't a hard rule,
it should be followed most of the time.


Problem File Structure
----------------------
- Answers to problems should exist in the following file path 
`<chapter of problem>/<section of problem>/<problem #>/<problem #>.py`
- All problems should contain a comment at the top containing 3 things:
the problem, the constraints of the problem, and your observations/approach to
the problem
