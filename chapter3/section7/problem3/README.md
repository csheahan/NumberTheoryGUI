### Thoughts ###

Another diophantine problem, this one the toughest so far. I forgot how to solve
a diophantine equation of the form `ax+by+cz=d`, so it took a little while just
to remember that. Once I remembered, I just had to code it out, which took a
little longer than I would have liked. Also, it seems that 4 inputs is when the
input starts getting a little large.
