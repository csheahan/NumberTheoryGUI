### Thoughts ###

This problem was at first intimidating, but quickly became quite a nice
problem to solve. I initially thought it would be an annoying problem,
but everything worked out quite nicely. The only real short cut I took was
that instead of recursively calling the pi function I just used a sieve for the
square root. Other than that, it just worked.
