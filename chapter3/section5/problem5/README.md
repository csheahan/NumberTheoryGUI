### Thoughts ###

Not too terrible of the problem given that I solved problem 3.5.4 in (what I
believe to be) the correct way. I just used my previous problems to get the
primes less than n using a sieve, check if n is prime itself, then use the
property that the exponent of a prime p in the prime power factorization of n!
is given by [n/p] + [n/p^2] + ... The proof of this can be seen in problem
3.5.4's README.
