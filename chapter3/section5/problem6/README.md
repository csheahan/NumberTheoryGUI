### Thoughts ###

Another fairly simple problem, especially utilizing previous problems to write
less code. The definition of a powerful number is a number n where for every
prime p that divides n, p^2 also divides p. For example, 4 is powerful because
for every p that divides 4 (only 2), p^2 also divides 4 (4 in this case).
